*** CS271 -- Computer Architecture and Assembly

Long story short: there will be no remasters of my assembly assignments.

Unfortunately, because of the instructor's policy that every student use the 
exact same version of Visual Studio to minimize discrepancies (which would be
a nightmare to grade, I'm sure), I had to maintain a VM exclusively for writing
these programs. That VM has since been purged. Perhaps one day, I'll create the
necessary environment to try MASM again, but higher-level technologies are my 
priority at this time. 

I'm particularly proud of how readable the code is, which is something I strove 
for with exceptional care. Given how low-level the material is, it was basically
a must.

Though I expect to never have to write assembly again, I feel grateful for 
having had the experience, and can't deny the knowledge has helped me on an 
incidental basis on a few occasions since the class ended.
