Huff's University Programming Exercise -- Remastered

For a very long time, I resisted publicly sharing my programming assignments and 
completed reports for fear of violating academic integrity standards. Now that I
have my diploma gathering dust on my mantle, and my savings account is dropping 
precipitously, I am throwing caution to the wind.

Calling it "refactoring" is often wildly inaccurate, because the functionality 
often needed to change to correctly solve a problem. Thus, the top of each 
source file is a "remastering" of an assignment I did poorly on grade-wise, or 
just produced something so ugly I needed to do it over again with my (slightly) 
improved sense of programming style. When feasible, files include a main() 
directly below the improved function for observing their functionality. 

Below all that is my hilarious first attempt, in all its ignominy. 

Fair warning: a lot of the code is hideous, and certainly even the remasters 
themselves are not optimal.

The point isn't to show off dinosauric knowledge, but to demonstrate that I am 
teachable and can make-do with what little practical knowledge I have.

This project is very much a work-in-progress, so check back in soon!
