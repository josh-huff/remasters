    These courses involved some coding (in some cases a LOT of it), but the 
    exercises were often highly reliant on context and consequently won't do
    much in the way of demonstrating my coding aptitude.
    
    However, these assignments may demonstrate my ability to design components 
    instead of merely filling in skeletons (CS340, CS361); think abstractly and 
    work with complexity (CS325, CS467); amd effectively communicate technical 
    concepts in a non-technical way (CS373, CS475).

    Some of these are group efforts, but since I have a degree in English,
    my group mates made certain I had a substantial stake in all of these texts.
